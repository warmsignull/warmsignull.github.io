title = 'Divergent Work Is Legitimate'
+++

Divergent work is often tolerated but rarely respected.

This is not because it is ineffective, but because it resists easy measurement. Non-linear progress, context switching, and delayed synthesis are difficult to supervise and easy to misclassify as inconsistency.

In this kind of work, short periods of high-intensity focus can produce as much progress as much longer periods of routine, well-defined execution. When evaluation relies primarily on visible activity or hours logged, this kind of progress is easy to misread.

In reality, divergent work is optimized for:

- Uncertain problem spaces
- Conceptual compression
- Boundary discovery
- Deep synthesis over time

This project treats divergent work as a legitimate and serious way of thinking, not as a deviation that must justify itself against factory expectations.
