title = 'Thinking Under Constraint'
+++

Constraint is not an inconvenience. It is information.

Systems become grounded when constraints are explicit and inescapable. They become fragile when constraints are softened, deferred, or replaced with narrative assurances.

Thinking under constraint means accepting that:

- Resources are finite
- Conditions change
- Information is incomplete
- Consequences are real

For me, this describes a relationship to reality: real systems, not abstract ones.

In real systems, failures surface immediately, trade-offs cannot be postponed, and correctness is not negotiable. Constraint forces clarity. Pretending becomes expensive. Judgment matters.

Much of the work documented here is an attempt to preserve this relationship to constraint inside modern software systems, where abstraction often hides cost, responsibility, and failure until it is too late.
