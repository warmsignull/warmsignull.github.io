# You’re amazing — thank you!

Your support just landed, and it means a lot. Right now everything is running in
Stripe’s test mode while I finish polishing the experience, but this is exactly
how the live flow will behave at launch.

### What happens next

- **Email receipt:** Stripe sends a confirmation automatically. If it doesn’t
  arrive within a few minutes, check spam or drop me a note.
- **Your message:** I’ve received the note and sharing preferences you included.
  Once test mode wraps, I’ll respond personally and celebrate supporters the way
  you prefer.
- **Curious to explore more?** Head back to the blog or try another donation
  (monthly or one-time) to see how the flow adapts.
