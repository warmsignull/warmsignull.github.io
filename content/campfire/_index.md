Campfire is the warm edge of the project.

It holds non-load-bearing material: jokes, fragments, small recognitions, and things that keep the work human. Nothing here is a commitment and nothing here is required reading.

If you are looking for decisions, constraints, or claims the project is willing to be judged on, start with [Camp](/camp/) and [Signal](/signal/) instead.
