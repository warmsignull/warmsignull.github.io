title = 'Contact With Reality'
+++

Most modern systems are designed to reduce contact with reality.

Not by removing constraints, which is impossible, but by delaying, diffusing, or obscuring them until consequences appear somewhere else, owned by no one in particular.

This work is oriented in the opposite direction.

Contact with reality means working close to constraints that cannot be negotiated away. It means keeping dependencies visible, making failure legible, and refusing abstractions that claim to eliminate responsibility rather than relocate it.

This stance is not nostalgic and not anti-abstraction. Abstraction is unavoidable. The question is whether it earns its place by remaining accountable to what it hides.

Throughout this project, contact with reality shows up in recurring concerns:

- Where memory lives and who owns it
- What authority exists and how it is exercised
- Which effects are permitted and which are forbidden
- How failure propagates
- What costs are real, even when hidden

This page exists to make that orientation explicit, so the rest of the work can be read correctly.
