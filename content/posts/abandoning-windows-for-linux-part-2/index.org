While I am still working on my method of delivery, what I hope those articles will give the readers, is to show all the benefits that they might not be aware of. Instead of making me look like an expert who makes no mistakes, I want to show how a true process of learning looks like, even for someone who is already experienced with technology. Show all the struggles and how by not giving up we can turn those struggles into self-improvement. Show how by doing the uncomfortable we can both improve ourselves and discover things that always were there, but by never venturing into the unknown we were not able to see their benefits. This is a highly technical and niche topic, yet those lessons are applicable to everyone in all aspects of life.


* Day 2

I have started researching about things that I want to do with my newly installed system, but shortly after I have ended up playing with sway desktop config and themes and did that for the most of the day.

It might seem like a wasted time, but it is both a discovery process and a way to start getting used to the new environment.

I have also started investigating about different browsers, desktop environments, file managers, terminals, firewalls, system logging and auditing.

There is definitely a huge benefit for the minimal desktop environment. While there is a lot of friction in getting used to tiling window manager and both learning and setting up the hotkeys at the same time, I can definitely see the future productivity benefits. Not having to reach for my mouse also lets me stay uninterrupted in the flow.

What I have also noticed, is that by not having all the clutter, not having notifications, and only having whatever I am working on visible on the screen has dramatically increased my focus. I have even disabled the clock. What happened, is that I was able to get into the zone and get lost in what I do again. Something that used to happen to me long, long time ago and I honestly stopped believing that it would be possible again. Before I knew, many hours have passed and I have done a lot of work.

* Day 3

Third day of my adventure exploring the unknown, searching for productivity and breaking old habits to make space for better ones.

The initial excitement has worn off a little and my morale is low.

I have eagerly powerd on my laptop today and got struck by new issues. VPN is not connecting and I have a kill switch active, which effectively means that I have no internet connection and have to do all my troubleshooting through my phone again. The issue? I have misconfigured my nftables. Turns out that after the reboot some setting have been applied that I thought were already applied and working previously.

Did some investigating and gave up on nftables for today, flushed to default settings.

There are so many things that I want to do to bring this system to higher standards that I am getting lost very easily and unable to decide on just one part to pursue.

This was an issue most of my life. Too many interests, too many things I want to do and not being able to finish them, or jumping between them and loosing focus.

The best way to make progress is to align the focus onto things corresponding to your current mental state. This is why I have decided to prioritize organizing my knowledge right now and leaving the details of the operating system for later. I have got it working to the point where it is usable and let's me do the organization and the other details are not as important now and can be postponed.

* Emacs

So I have stumbled upon this a while ago and didn't really see the benefits.

Emacs was released in 1976. It is pretty ancient and niche piece of technology, yet it does something incredible.

The problem with it, is that it is extremely hard to explain and make someone see the benefits. It is very unintuitive at first. Why would I need a text editor? There are plenty of those already out there. So what that it can be customized, so can others.

And I have felt the same way, untill one day, something aligned in my brain and gave me that AHA moment.

Think of Emacs as a super-customizable notebook or workspace.
You can write text, organize tasks, keep notes, and even browse the web, all in one place.
It looks old-school but is very powerful once set up.
You usually control it with the keyboard, but you can use the mouse too.

* Org Mode

Org Mode is like turning Emacs into a smart planner + notebook.

You can:
- Write notes
- Make to-do lists
- Schedule tasks

Keep ideas organized with simple outlines (-, *, and headings)

It’s plain text, so you can open your files anywhere, but Emacs turns it into something interactive.

* Org-roam

Org-roam is like having a brain that connects your notes automatically.
When you write a note, you can link it to other notes (like Wikipedia links).
Over time, it builds a “web of thoughts”, so you can see how your ideas connect.
Writers, researchers, and thinkers love this because it turns random notes into a connected knowledge system.

* Org-journal

Org-journal is just what it sounds like, a digital diary inside Emacs.
You open today’s page, write your thoughts, and it automatically dates and organizes everything.
You can search past entries instantly.

* How it all fits together

Emacs is the tool that runs everything.

Org Mode gives you structure (tasks, notes, outlines).
Org-roam connects your notes into a network.
Org-journal gives you a daily writing habit that feeds into that network.

Together, it becomes a personal knowledge system: a mix of diary, planner, and wiki, that you fully own and control.

* Benefits

Everything is yours (no cloud lock-in or ads).
Notes are plain text (safe forever, no special app needed).
You can link ideas like in your brain.
Works offline and fast.
Can be as simple or as advanced as you want.

It gives you an unified environment for managing and organizing all your life and knowledge.

The drawback? The learning curve is extremely steep and this is where most people drop out. Honestly, even when I was reading all those explanations I did not see how it could be worth it, untill I tried it. It is a matter of deciding whether spending quite a bit of time learning something new is worth the benefits that it will give you for the rest of your life. And for me, it definitely is.

Org roam mode uses Zettelkasten system, which is a method created by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who wrote over 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles during his career. If you have ever been drowning in notes, or used different note keeping and organization systems that didn't work out, definitely give this one a try.

This is how it looked like for him:

Needless to say, it is much easier and works much better when combined with technology. If this system has allowed Niklas Lihmann to write so many books and articles even when doing it physically by hand, how much of an improvement could it be when combined with technology? In my opinion, by multiple magnitudes.
