## Weather States

Weather describes **conditions of visibility**, not effort or productivity.  
It exists to explain how the work should be interpreted from the outside.

The states below are intentionally coarse. They change only when the **mode of work** changes.

---

### **Clear**

The terrain is visible.

The project’s shape, intent, and core artifacts are available and legible. Progress continues incrementally from a known structure. New work tends to surface directly rather than remaining compressed for long periods.

Silence, if it occurs, reflects normal pacing rather than uncertainty or blockage.

---

### **High Pressure**

The structure is compressing.

Work is focused on resolving hard constraints or aligning core ideas. Internal structure is consolidating faster than it can surface. Visible output may be sparse or delayed until coherence improves.

This state usually precedes the release of dense or foundational artifacts.

---

### **Overcast**

Visibility is reduced.

Work continues, but what surfaces does not reflect the full state of the system. Updates may appear partial, indirect, or disconnected until underlying constraints resolve.

This is not exploratory uncertainty, but limited external legibility.

---

### **Fog**

Exploration dominates.

New territory is being mapped. Shape exists, but it is not yet stable or readable from the outside. Notes, experiments, or fragments may appear before conclusions.

Expect discontinuity and revision when clarity emerges.

---

### **Storm**

External constraints dominate conditions.

Progress may slow, fragment, or temporarily disappear from view. This reflects environmental pressure rather than internal design uncertainty.

Storms pass, they do not imply abandonment or collapse.

---

### **Thaw**

Previously frozen work is re-emerging.

Constraints have eased. Work that was blocked or compressed begins to surface and reconnect. Output may arrive unevenly as structure reasserts itself.

---

### **Deep Winter**

Intentional consolidation or pause.

The priority is integration, recovery, or protecting coherence rather than producing visible artifacts. This state favors durability over motion.

---

### **Front Passing**

A transition is underway.

Assumptions are shifting, boundaries are being reevaluated, or the mode of work is changing. Expect reorientation and occasional discontinuities as the system settles into a new state.
