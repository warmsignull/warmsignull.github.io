Welcome. Pull up a chair, preferably one that survived your last rage-quit.

I’m building a custom programming language, a VM, and the surrounding tooling,
while documenting the why just as much as the how. That means long-form
reasoning, design tradeoffs, historical context, failed ideas, and the
occasional moment where something finally clicks after weeks of staring at it.

## What to expect

- **Language & systems design** – virtual machines, type systems, effects,
  error handling, memory models, and the sharp edges people usually skip.

- **Design writing** – motivation essays, position-style arguments, and
  problem-space exploration.

- **Computing history** – older systems and ideas that solved problems we keep
  rediscovering.

New posts land here first. Some are exploratory, some are deep dives.

I use Arch btw.
