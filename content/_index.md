Warm Signull documents the long-term design and implementation of a custom programming language, virtual machine, and supporting tooling, alongside the reasoning, failures, and constraints that shape them.

The work is guided by a preference for **contact with reality**: systems that admit what they depend on, expose their boundaries, and remain legible under pressure. Abstractions are treated as choices with costs, not as neutral conveniences.

This site records decisions, trade-offs, corrections, and failures as the work progresses, with the intent of making the reasoning as durable as the code itself.

The emphasis is on design constraints and failure modes that are usually undocumented or discarded once code ships.

This is not a short-term experiment. The work is pursued with a long horizon and a willingness to move slowly where understanding matters more than speed.

## Orientation

If you want to understand the thinking behind this work before diving into code or design notes, start with these pages:

- [Why Another Language](/why-another-language/)  
  Coming soon.

- [Contact With Reality](/contact-with-reality/)  
  A statement of stance and orientation toward abstraction, constraints, and accountability.

- [Abstraction, Indirection, and Accountability](/abstraction-indirection-accountability/)  
  On when abstraction earns its place and when it becomes insulation.

- [Thinking Under Constraint](/thinking-under-constraint/)  
  On dependency, failure, responsibility, and legibility under pressure.

- [Fieldcraft vs Factory Thinking](/fieldcraft-vs-factory-thinking/)  
  Why many technical problems are treated as factory work despite being field problems.

- [Seriousness, Play, and Human Cognition](/seriousness-play-human-cognition/)  
  Why excessive dryness becomes self sabotage, and why humor and warmth are functional.

- [Divergent Work Is Legitimate](/divergent-work-is-legitimate/)  
  On non-linear work as a serious and equal way of thinking.

These pages explain why the project looks the way it does.

## Current focus

- Language design constraints and trade-offs
- Tooling required for a minimal but complete system
- Writing and publishing design rationale alongside code

## How this site is organized

The site is structured around different **states of work**, rather than treating everything as equally finished.

### [Camp](/camp/)

Foundations, constraints, and load-bearing decisions.

---

### [Trail](/posts/)

Chronological posts as the work unfolds.

---

### [Signal](/signal/)

Work I am prepared to stand behind publicly.

---

### [Weather](/weather/)

Current working conditions and cadence.

---

### [Campfire](/campfire/)

Personal notes, side thoughts, and non-serious writing.

---

## [Support](/support/)

All work on Warm Signull is developed and published publicly.  
There is no gated content and no private access.

Support increases the time and attention available for deep, constraint-driven design, implementation, and documentation.

In practical terms, this tends to mean:

- more time spent on foundational design rather than surface features
- more thorough documentation of trade-offs and failure modes
- more Signal-level writing that can be cited, reused, and built upon

Support does not change the direction of the work.  
It changes how much depth and care can be applied to it.

This is most relevant to people comfortable supporting long-horizon thinking rather than constant output.
