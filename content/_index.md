## Warm Signull

Warm Signull documents the long-term design and implementation of a custom programming language, virtual machine, and supporting tooling, alongside the reasoning, failures, and constraints that shape them.

The work is guided by a preference for **contact with reality**: systems that admit what they depend on, expose their boundaries, and remain legible under pressure. Abstractions are treated as choices with costs, not as neutral conveniences.

This site records decisions, trade-offs, corrections, and failures as the work progresses, with the intent of making the reasoning as durable as the code itself.

This is not a short-term experiment. The work is pursued with a long horizon and a willingness to move slowly where understanding matters more than speed.

## Orientation

If you want to understand the thinking behind this work before diving into code or design notes, start with these pages:

- [Contact With Reality](/contact-with-reality/)  
  A statement of stance and orientation toward abstraction, constraints, and accountability.

- [Abstraction, Indirection, and Accountability](/abstraction-indirection-accountability/)  
  On when abstraction earns its place and when it becomes insulation.

- [Thinking Under Constraint](/thinking-under-constraint/)  
  On dependency, failure, responsibility, and legibility under pressure.

- [Fieldcraft vs Factory Thinking](/fieldcraft-vs-factory-thinking/)  
  Why many technical problems are treated as factory work despite being field problems.

- [Seriousness, Play, and Human Cognition](/seriousness-play-human-cognition/)  
  Why excessive dryness becomes self sabotage, and why humor and warmth are functional.

- [Divergent Work Is Legitimate](/divergent-work-is-legitimate/)  
  On non-linear work as a serious and equal way of thinking.

These pages explain why the project looks the way it does.

## Current focus

- Language design constraints and trade-offs
- Tooling required for a minimal but complete system
- Writing and publishing design rationale alongside code
