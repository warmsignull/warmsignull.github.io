Welcome, pull up a chair, preferably one that survived your last rage-quit
session. This corner of the internet is where I overthink technology, write
code that definitely needed another `git commit --amend`, and poke the big
philosophical bear just enough to keep things interesting.

## What to expect (and what to blame me for)

- **Technology** — hype breakdowns, trend chasing, and the occasional “this is
  probably Skynet” hot take.
- **Programming** — tutorials, bug confessions, and snippets that only work on
  my machine (until you read the post, obviously).
- **Philosophy** — thought experiments, meaning-of-life detours, and memeing my
  way through existential dread.

New posts land here first. Jump into the archive, filter by topic on the
Topics page, or doom-scroll the social links below for more chaos.

I use Arch btw.
