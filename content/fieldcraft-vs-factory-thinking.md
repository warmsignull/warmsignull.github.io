title = 'Fieldcraft vs Factory Thinking'
+++

Factory thinking assumes stable inputs, predictable outputs, and constant cadence.

Fieldcraft assumes variable terrain, incomplete information, and judgment under uncertainty.

Many modern technical problems are field problems treated as factory work. The result is brittle systems, premature certainty, and progress that looks smooth until it collapses.

Fieldcraft does not reject structure. It uses different structure:

- Orientation over schedules
- Boundaries over checklists
- Adaptation over compliance

This distinction explains much of the project’s workflow, cadence, and separation between exploration and commitment.
