title = 'Fieldcraft vs Factory Thinking'
+++

Factory thinking assumes stable inputs, predictable outputs, and constant cadence. It optimizes for repeatability, throughput, and schedule adherence.

**Fieldcraft** assumes variable terrain, incomplete information, and judgment under uncertainty. It optimizes for orientation, adaptation, and survival under changing conditions.

Many modern technical problems are **field problems treated as factory work**. The result is brittle systems, premature certainty, and progress that looks smooth until it collapses.

Fieldcraft does not reject structure. It relies on **different structure**:

- orientation over schedules
- boundaries over checklists
- adaptation over compliance

This distinction explains much of the project’s workflow, cadence, and separation between **exploration and commitment**. It also explains why progress may appear uneven while understanding accumulates underneath.
