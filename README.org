An unapologetically dark Hugo site that mixes tech rants, code experiments, and
philosophical side quests. Visitors can flip the theme to light mode with a tiny
moon and sun toggle, filter posts by tag on the Topics page, and browse every
article through the Archive.

** Requirements
- Hugo extended v0.152.2 or newer
- Python 3 (optional, only used here to generate sample images)

** Local development
Run the Hugo dev server with drafts enabled:

#+begin_src sh
hugo server -D
#+end_src

** Content structure
- Posts live under =content/posts/<slug>/index.md= along with any images for that
  post.
- Site-wide pages such as Topics, Projects, and Archive live in their own
  sections under =content/<section>/_index.md=.

If you prefer scaffolding, you can generate a post bundle with:

#+begin_src sh
hugo new content posts/my-new-post/index.md
#+end_src

** Theming highlights
- Default theme is dark and respects a stored preference in =localStorage=.
- Header toggle is icon-only for a clean look.
- Projects page pulls card data from =data/projects.toml=.
- Topics page includes client side tag filtering.

** Deployment
The repository ships with a GitHub Actions workflow that builds with Hugo and
deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to =master=. No manual build step required.
